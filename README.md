as a manual qa this repository is to show on how i'm using automate to run my test scenarios.

I have learned the basics of Robot Framework with Selenium to automate tests from my own test cases.
You might notice that some of the code or keywords are a bit clunky or inefficient, as this is my first time coding it.

Unfortunately, the project has been on hold since I last worked on it. However, I had tried using it before, and it worked.
